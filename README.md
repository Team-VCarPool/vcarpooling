# VCarPooling

The purpose of V-carpooling is the sharing of car journey so that more than one person/employee can travel in a car. The greatest advantage
of carpooling is the feeling of relaxation while reaching to office. You donâ€™t need to struggle all the way driving to office and feel
relaxed - No Parking / Traffic tensions. The feeling of relaxation rejuvenates you to start your work natural fresh. And also Carpooling
reduces the costs involved in car travel by sharing journey expenses between the employees travelling. Carpooling is also seen as a more
environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic on the roads, and the need for
parking spaces. So it builds virtual relationships in our organization among the people commuting.
